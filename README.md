# iOS 3D Secure SDK from Checkout.com

The Checkout.com 3D Secure (3DS) mobile SDK allows you to provide a native 3DS2 experience in your mobile app, with visual styling that you can control. 

The SDK handles the device data collection, communication with the card issuer, and presentation of 3D Secure challenges to the customer when required.

## Features
1. Supports **3D Secure protocols 2.1.0 and 2.2.0.**
2. Presents **native 3DS2 challenge screens to the user, with styling that you can customise** to best fit your apps and branding.
3. Optionally **falls back to 3DS1** when 3DS2 is not available, returning the same authentication result to your app as for 3DS2. (This option can be configured by Checkout.com for your account.)
4. Supports a **range of local languages and accessibility needs**, and allows you to set your own string translations.
5. Meets requirements from **EMVCo and the PCI Security Standards Council**, specifically set for 3DS SDKs, so you can be sure it is interoperable with card issuers and that your customersâ€™ sensitive data stays secure.

## Minimum Requirements
The 3DS SDK for iOS requires Xcode 12.0 and above with Swift version 5.3 and above, and supports apps targeting iOS 11.0 and above. It also supports Objective-C.

## Getting Started

First, integrate the 3DS SDK into your app.

Then, configure your app to:

1. Initialize the SDK with your preferred user interface options.
2. Configure the parameters for an authentication.
3. Request authentication and handle the result to continue your payment flow.

## Dependencies

The iOS SDK depends on some external libraries:
