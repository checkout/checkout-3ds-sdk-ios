## Features
- Supports **3D Secure protocols 2.1.0 and 2.2.0.**
- Presents **native 3DS2 challenge screens to the user, with styling that you can customise** to best fit your apps and branding.
- Optionally **falls back to 3DS1** when 3DS2 is not available, returning the same authentication result to your app as for 3DS2. (This option can be configured by Checkout.com for your account.)
- Supports a **range of local languages and accessibility needs**, and allows you to set your own string translations.
- Meets requirements from **EMVCo and the PCI Security Standards Council**, specifically set for 3DS SDKs, so you can be sure it is interoperable with card issuers and that your customersâ€™ sensitive data stays secure.

## Minimum Requirements
- The 3DS SDK for iOS requires Xcode 14.1 and above with Swift version 5.8 and above, and supports apps targeting iOS 12.0 and above. It also supports Objective-C. 
- We have discontinued support for intel machines (x86_64 architecture based environments). You must use ARM64 architecture based environments to compile our 3DS iOS SDK.


## Installation

We've done our best to support the most common distribution methods on iOS. We are in strong favour of [SPM](#Swift-Package-Manager) (Swift Package Manager) but if for any reason this doesn't work for you, we also support [Cocoapods](#Cocoapods).

### Swift Package Manager
[Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies. It should work out of the box on latest Xcode projects since Xcode 11 and has had a lot of community support, seeing huge adoption over the recent years. This is our preferred distribution method for Frames iOS and is the easiest one to integrate, keep updated and build around.

If you've never used it before, get started with Apple's step by step guide into [adding package dependencies to your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-package-dependencies-to-your-app) . 

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/checkout/checkout-3ds-sdk-ios", from: "3.2.3")
```

### CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is the traditional dependency manager for Apple projects. We still support it, but we're not always able to validate all its peculiar ways.

Make sure cocoapods is installed on your machine by running
```bash
$ pod --version
```
Any version newer than **1.10.0** is a good sign. If not installed, or unsupported, follow [Cocoapods Getting Started](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)

Once Cocoapods of a valid version is on your machine, to integrate Frames into your Xcode project, update your `Podfile`:
```ruby
platform :ios, '12.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
  pod 'Checkout3DS', :git => 'git@github.com:checkout/checkout-3ds-sdk-ios.git', :tag => '3.2.3'
end

post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings['BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION'] = 'YES'
      config.build_settings['EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*]'] = 'i386  x86_64'
      config.build_settings['IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'] = '12.0'
    end
  end
end

```

Then, run the following command in terminal:

```bash
$ pod install
```
Note: your Pod setup may have the following [issue](https://github.com/checkout/checkout-3ds-sdk-ios/issues/4)

To update your existing Cocoapod dependencies, use:
```bash
$ pod update
```


Then, configure your app to:

## Integration

### Checkout.com's 3DS server
This integration method involves one call to our `authenticate` method, which will perform an entire Authentication flow using Checkout.com's 3DS servers.

1. Initialize the SDK with your preferred user interface options using our `uiCustomization` object.
2. Configure the parameters for an authentication.
3. Request authentication and handle the result to continue your payment flow.
4. The authenticate function now returns `Result` type with two cases
    - `AuthenticationResult` with `transactionStatus` and `sdkTransactionID`  ðŸ‘‰&nbsp;&nbsp;[More info about transaction status](https://www.checkout.com/docs/business-operations/use-the-dashboard/payment-activity/track-3ds-events#Transaction_status)
    - `AuthenticationError` with a `message`.

#### Code snippet

```swift
// 1. Init with defaults
let checkout3DS = Checkout3DSService()

// 2. Init with explicit arguments
let checkout3DS = Checkout3DSService(
    environment: .production,
    locale: Locale(identifier: "en_GB"),
    uiCustomization: uiCustomization,
    appURL: URL(string: "myapp://my-app-url")!
)

let authenticationParameters = AuthenticationParameters(
    sessionID: sessionID,
    sessionSecret: sessionSecret,
    scheme: scheme)

checkout3DS.authenticate(authenticationParameters: authenticationParameters) { result in
    switch authenticationResult {
    case .success(let authenticationResult):
        // handle authentication result. Checkout Payment Authorisation section.
    case .failure(let error):
        // handle failure scenarios
     }
}
```

### Any 3DS provider
Standalone 3DS allows our SDKs to be used with any Authentication provider, be it Checkout.com or otherwise. This is a higher touch integration that breaks up the 3DS flow more granularly. In order to integrate with the Standalone 3DS service:

1. Initialize the SDK with your preferred user interface options using our `uiCustomization` object.
2. Create `transaction` object 
3. Get `authenticationRequestParameters` for the AReq
4. If a challenge is mandated from the Authentication response from your 3DS server then call the `doChallenge` method to render the challenge however, if the challenge is not mandated by the ACS then it would have triggered a frictionless 3DS flow. 

#### End-to-end 3DS flow
Here is a useful diagram that highlights the end-to-end 3DS flow using our `standalone3DSService`.
![E2E Standalone SDK Flow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102961713/226956636-d39b7bff-9fb8-4701-a3bc-86d932b306f0.jpg)

#### Code snippet 

1- Creates an instance of `ThreeDS2Service` through which the 3DS Requestor App can create a transaction object to get the `authenticationRequestParameters` that are required to perform a challenge:

```swift
   private var transaction: Transaction?
   private var standalone3DSService: ThreeDS2Service?
````

2-Initialize the SDK with your preferred user interface options:

- `scheme` can be set only as `visa` and `mastercard` in lowercase string.

```swift
// initialise Standalone 3DS Service with required parameters

do {
   let directoryServerData = ThreeDS2ServiceConfiguration.DirectoryServerData(directoryServerID: <directoryServerID>,
                                                                              directoryServerPublicKey: <ds_public>,
                                                                              directoryServerRootCertificates: [<caPublic>])
   let configParameters = ThreeDS2ServiceConfiguration.ConfigParameters(directoryServerData: directoryServerData,
                                                                        messageVersion: <messageVersion>,
                                                                        scheme: <scheme>)
    let serviceConfiguration = ThreeDS2ServiceConfiguration(configParameters: configParameters)
      
    self.standalone3DSService = try Standalone3DSService.initialize(with: serviceConfiguration)
   }  catch let error {
      // handle failure scenario
   }
```

3. Create `transaction` using created `ThreeDS2Service` object:

```swift
  self.transaction = self.standalone3DSService?.createTransaction()
```

4. Retrieve the `authenticationRequestParameters`:
```swift
 // get Authentication Request parameters
 self.transaction?.getAuthenticationRequestParameters { result in
     switch result {
     case .success(let params):
        // make an Authentication Request to your 3DS Server
     case .failure(let error):
        // handle failure scenario
      }
}

```
5. Handle the `doChallenge` flow: 

- If the Authentication response that is returned indicates that the Challenge Flow must be applied, the 3DS Requestor App calls the `doChallenge` method with the required input `ChallengeParameters`. The `doChallenge` method initiates the challenge process.
- The `doChallenge` function now returns `Result` type with two cases
  - `AuthenticationResult` with `transactionStatus` and `sdkTransactionID`  ðŸ‘‰&nbsp;&nbsp;[More info about transaction status](https://www.checkout.com/docs/business-operations/use-the-dashboard/payment-activity/track-3ds-events#Transaction_status)
  - `AuthenticationError` with a `message`.


```swift
let params = ChallengeParameters(threeDSServerTransactionID: response.transactionId,
                                 acsTransactionID: response.acs.transactionId,
                                 acsRefNumber: response.acs.referenceNumber,
                                 acsSignedContent: response.acs.signedContent)
transaction?.doChallenge(challengeParameters: params, completion: { [weak self] result in
     switch result {
      case .success(let authenticationResult):
         // handle authentication result. Checkout Payment Authorisation section.
      case .failure(let error):
         // handle failure scenario
       }
      // call close and cleanUp methods after challenge flow is completed. 
      self?.transaction?.close()
      self?.standalone3DSService?.cleanUp()
})

```

6. Service `cleanUp` and transaction `close`:  

- After a challenge/frictionless flow is completed, you should call:
```swift
    transaction?.close()
    standalone3DSService?.cleanUp()
```

## Payment Authorisation
After initiating the authentication process and obtaining the `AuthenticationResult` object, you can continue the authentication flow based on the value of `transStatus`:

| `transStatus` | Description                            | Proceed with Payment Authorisation Request |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------------------- | :--------------------|
| `Y`                 | Authentication verification successful.| Yes |
| `A`                 | Attempt at processing performed.       | Yes |
| `I`                 | Informational only.                    | Yes |
| `N`                 | Not authenticated or account not verified.| No  |
| `R`                 | Authentication or account verification rejected.| No  |
| `U`                 | Authentication or account verification could not be performed.| No  |

## Dependencies

Our iOS SDK depends on some external libraries:

* To help maintain security, we use [JOSESwift](https://github.com/airsidemobile/JOSESwift). To overcome the limitation in Swift Package Manager (SPM) related to binary target dependencies, we've integrated JOSESwift as an xcframework sourced from the same [JOSESwift](https://github.com/airsidemobile/JOSESwift).
* To help provide support and monitor the performance of the SDK, we use our own Checkout Event Logger Kit.
